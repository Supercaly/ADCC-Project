Erlang~\cite{Cesarini,Armstrong} is a general purpose, functional, concurrent programming language originally developed by Ericsson.
The peculiarity of Erlang is that is has been developed to work with fault resiliant distributed systems (originally telephony switches), hence it natively supports high degree of concurrency, light-weight processes and  failure mechanisms. Erlang concurrency model is based on the Actor model~\cite{actor}: an actor is a light-weight process endowed with a mailbox and univocally identified by a process ID (PID). PIDs are the only way to know actors and to communicate with them: to send a message to an actor one needs to know its PID. Also, PIDs can be send around with messages, making the discovery of actors very simple.
