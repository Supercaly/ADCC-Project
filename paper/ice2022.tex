\begin{abstract}
Tuple space is a paradigm for parallel and distributed computing, made popular by its Linda implementation.
The idea of tuple space is very simple: it consists of a (distributed) repository where agents can read, write and withdrawn tuples in an atomic way. Tuples can contain arbitrary values, and are accessed by means of pattern-matching. Despite its simplicity, there is a lack of working implementations due to the fact that guaranteeng a distributed tuple space with atomic operations may lead to consistency and performances problems.  In this paper, we try to cope with this  problems by resorting to a programming language which is natively designed to work in distributed environments: Erlang.
